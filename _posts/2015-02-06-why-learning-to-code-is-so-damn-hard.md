##Why Learning to Code is So Damn Hard

This isn't actually a blog post as much as just sharing an article I liked. I think most developers, especially those that didn't take the CS degree route, can relate to this. Particularly that moment that you close down the Codecademy window to start your own project, and within 10 seconds realize you have no idea what the hell is going on.

I also couldn't agree more with the fact that no one resource is going to teach you what you need to know. Each of them has glaring holes and a different focus. Only going to be able to fill these gaps by using all of the resources, book, blogs, YouTube tutorials available.

Enjoy the read.
